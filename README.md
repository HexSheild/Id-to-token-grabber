# Id-to-token-grabber
A simple tool that where u can put any discord id and it will bruteforce the token of the account id
Discord token grabber
# Introduction
This program is a proof of concept designed to highlight security vulnerabilities within Discord's service by extracting Discord tokens from Google Chrome files. These tokens grant unauthorized access to accounts, allowing visibility into private conversations, servers, friends, and other sensitive details without the account owner's knowledge.

The primary goal of this tool is educational, aiming to demonstrate potential exploits by bad actors due to common oversights in security practices. It is intended to raise awareness about the ease of account compromise and to encourage better security measures among Discord users.

# Disclaimer
This tool is provided for educational purposes only to showcase vulnerabilities in Discord's security mechanisms. It is not intended, nor should it be used, to gain unauthorized access to accounts. The program supports only Google Chrome as it is a proof of concept, highlighting that the issue is not browser-specific but a broader concern with online account security.

# Security Measures and Recommendations
If you suspect your account has been compromised by a similar exploit:

Change Your Password: Immediately changing your Discord password invalidates old tokens, preventing further unauthorized access.
Use Antivirus Software: Scan your device for malicious programs that may be exploiting vulnerabilities or stealing information.
Be Cautious: Avoid running unknown code or programs from untrusted sources. This is a common way attackers gain access to your devices and accounts.
Avoid Sharing Browser Developer Tools Data: If someone asks you to use the developer tools in your browser to type commands, show your network activity, or reveal your local storage while you have Discord open, be highly suspicious. These actions can lead to your Discord tokens being extracted, putting your account at risk. There is a very high likelihood that such requests are hacking attempts. It's crucial to safeguard your information and not comply with these requests from individuals you do not trust.
# Limitations of the Program
User Execution Required: The program must be run on the victim's machine, emphasizing the importance of caution when executing unknown programs or scripts.
Token Accumulation Issue: In cases where multiple Discord accounts are used, or passwords are frequently changed, the large number of tokens discovered may exceed message character limits, preventing their transmission.
Browser Support: Currently, this proof of concept only targets Google Chrome. However, the vulnerability is not limited to a single browser and can potentially be demonstrated across different platforms, including the Discord client itself.
# Conclusion
This project serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing risks and challenges in digital security, particularly within widely used platforms like Discord. By understanding these vulnerabilities, users can take proactive steps to secure their accounts and personal information against unauthorized access.

# Usage Guide
first just open the tool and install the requirement txt and then open the tool and put the discord id of target and i advise u to use proxy bcz disocrd will limit ur ip so use proxy this tool i tried it and i got someons token within 5 days so its working enjoy>>>!
